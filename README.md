# IDC409_LeafClassification
An CNN (**C**onvolutional **N**eural **N**etwork) Model to differentiate between three different kind of leaves.

The three ipynb files, are iterative process of us learning how to do multiclassification. The first one labeled Binary_Classification can be used to make and save a Binary Classifcation model. The last one, 
Leaf_classifcation_main.ipynb is the file with the most comments and our submission for this project.
The trained model named Leaf_classification.h5 is too big to upload here, which is why it has also been uploaded in the drive link below.

The dataset we have used for training and testing can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PpYSQwf96x5jJB33xC0HkEP8miRNZ20J?usp=drive_link)
